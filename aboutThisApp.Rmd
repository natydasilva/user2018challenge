###Introduction
This project aims to provide some insights about the distribution of some plants species around south Australia.
Ecologists have been operating on the latitude gradient, as we get closer to the equator, species richness is greater. We can see the some back story of this theory from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitudinal_gradients_in_species_diversity). We design a small Shiny App to see that is not true for Australian plants. Our theory says for Australia "greater species richness the closer to the south pole".

###Application Structure and Design
Here we explained how we want to
